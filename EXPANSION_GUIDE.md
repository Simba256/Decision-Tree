# Career Decision Tree - Systematic Expansion Guide

## ✅ What's Been Added

**Collapsible Nodes Feature:**
- Click the **−** button in the top-left corner of any node to collapse its entire subtree
- Click the **+** button to expand it again
- This allows you to manage hundreds or thousands of nodes by hiding branches you're not currently exploring
- The tree now scales to handle 10+ branches at the first level and 1000+ total nodes

## 📋 Systematic Expansion Strategy

### Phase 0: Starting Point (Root Level)
Instead of starting with just "L3 Embedded AI at Motive", create multiple root branches:

```
ROOT: "You Today - Year 0"
├── 🎓 Masters/Higher Education
├── 💼 Continue Working (Current Path)
├── 📈 Trading / Finance Career
├── 🚀 Start Own Company / Startup
├── 🌐 Freelance / Consulting
├── 🔄 Career Switch (Different Field)
└── 🎯 Hybrid Paths (Combination)
```

## 🛠 Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Start Small
Don't add everything at once. Add branches incrementally:
1. Add Masters branch first (since it's well-defined)
2. Add Startup branch next
3. Then Trading, etc.

### Step 2: Use Phases Consistently
Map new paths to the same 4 phases:
- **Phase 1 (Yr 0-2):** Initial decision & setup
- **Phase 2 (Yr 2-4):** Early results & pivots
- **Phase 3 (Yr 4-7):** Maturity & growth
- **Phase 4 (Yr 7-10):** Final outcomes

### Step 3: Data Collection
For each new branch, research and add:
- **Probabilities:** Based on statistics, market data, personal assessment
- **Salary/Returns:** Realistic ranges (use Glassdoor, Levels.fyi, etc.)
- **Costs:** Tuition, living expenses, opportunity cost
- **Notes:** Key insights, risks, recommendations

### Step 4: Use Collapse Feature
- Start with all branches collapsed
- Expand only the path you're currently evaluating
- This keeps the visualization manageable

## 📊 Example: Adding Masters Branch

Here's how you'd structure the code for a Masters branch:

```javascript
// Add to NODES object
p0_masters: {
  id: "p0_masters", phase: 0,
  label: "🎓 Pursue\nMasters Degree",
  salary: "Cost: 2-10M PKR\n(varies by location)",
  prob: 0.15, // 15% chance you choose this
  color: "#a29bfe",
  note: "Higher education path. Consider location, funding, ROI.",
  children: ["p1_masters_pakistan", "p1_masters_europe", "p1_masters_usa", "p1_masters_online"]
},

p1_masters_pakistan: {
  id: "p1_masters_pakistan", phase: 1,
  label: "Masters in\nPakistan\n(LUMS/NUST)",
  salary: "Cost: 2-4M PKR\n2 years",
  prob: 0.40, // 40% of masters seekers stay local
  color: "#a29bfe",
  note: "Lower cost, stay with family, but limited global opportunities post-degree.",
  children: ["p2_masters_pk_job", "p2_masters_pk_phd"]
},

// ... and so on
```

Then add to root:
```javascript
root: {
  id: "root", phase: -1,
  label: "YOU TODAY\nYear 0",
  salary: "220K PKR/mo",
  prob: 1.0, color: "#00ff9f",
  children: [
    "p0_continue_motive",  // Your current tree
    "p0_masters",          // New branch
    "p0_startup",          // New branch
    "p0_trading",          // New branch
    // etc.
  ]
}
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Refresh the browser** - The collapse/expand feature is now live
2. **Test collapsing** - Click the − button on "Leave Motive" to hide its descendants
3. **Plan expansion** - Decide which branch to add first (I recommend Masters)
4. **Gather data** - Research probabilities, costs, salaries for that branch
5. **Update NODES** - Add the new nodes following the structure above
6. **Test & iterate** - See how it looks, adjust as needed

Would you like me to help you implement one of these branches completely, or would you prefer to start with a different expansion strategy?
