# Calibration Weights for Profile-Based Edge Probability Adjustment
# ===================================================================
#
# All tunable calibration weights in one place.
# A multiplier > 1.0 boosts an edge probability, < 1.0 suppresses it,
# and 1.0 means no change.
#
# These weights are applied to career path edges based on user profile
# factors, then child groups are re-normalized to sum to 1.0.
